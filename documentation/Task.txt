3Skye back end developer tech test:

Application stub
Please check out the 3Skye interview application from Git.

This is an application stub built with Spring Boot and Maven.  The existing application contains a basic database schema and sample data. The application is fully runnable and launches a webserver on localhost port 8080.  Currently a single API endpoint is implemented at GET /hello

A schematic diagram of the included database is included at the end of this document, and the code is in /src/main/resources/data.sql. An H2 client is available at http://localhost:8080/h2-console

Task
Below is a swagger for a new API.  Please implement this swagger into the Spring Boot application.  

For the purposes of the test, the following technique should be employed:
•	Use Test Driven Development
•	Please document any design decisions and algorithm choices, with reasoning.

      
Task 2
A simple functions controller has been stubbed with some basic algorithms.  Please implement these.
Both tasks are of equal importance, and you have 1 hour.  It is up to you how you division your time, but you need to have shown progress on both.
      
      
Time limit: 1hr
